# Account Creator README

## Overview
This Python script is designed to automate the account creation process on a website, referred to as "Kick" in the code. It generates random usernames, fills out the registration form, retrieves a verification code from an email, accepts terms and conditions, and follows a specified channel. The script is intended for creating multiple bot accounts for a given channel on the website.

**Note:** The script uses a variety of libraries, including Selenium, Undetected Chromedriver, and others to interact with the website. It is important to respect the website's terms of service and any applicable laws when using this script.

## Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (install them using `pip`):
    - `requests`
    - `imaplib`
    - `email`
    - `nltk`
    - `undetected-chromedriver`
    - `fake-useragent`

You'll also need a working email server (IMAP) to receive the verification codes.

## Configuration
In the script, you will need to configure some variables and settings to match your requirements:

- `working_domains`: Add the email domains where you want to create accounts.
- `imap_server`, `username`, and `password`: Set your IMAP email server and login credentials for email verification.
- `amount_of_bots` and `channel_name`: Specify the number of bot accounts you want to create and the name of the channel you want to follow.

## Usage
To run the script, execute it with the required command-line arguments:

```
python account_creator.py <amount_of_bots> <channel_name>
```

- `<amount_of_bots>`: The number of bot accounts you want to create.
- `<channel_name>`: The name of the channel you want to follow.

## Script Execution
The script performs the following steps for each bot account:

1. Generates a random username.
2. Chooses a random email domain.
3. Initializes a Chrome browser instance using Selenium and Undetected Chromedriver.
4. Fills out the registration form on the website.
5. Retrieves a verification code from the specified email address.
6. Accepts the terms and conditions.
7. Follows the specified channel.
8. Saves cookies for future logins.
9. Repeats these steps for the specified number of bot accounts.

The script also provides status updates during execution.

## Important Considerations
- Use this script responsibly and only for legitimate purposes.
- Ensure you have the necessary rights and permissions to create accounts on the website.
- Be aware that websites may have measures to prevent automated account creation, which this script attempts to bypass.

Please respect the terms of service and policies of the website you are interacting with. Unauthorized or improper use of this script may result in legal consequences.
